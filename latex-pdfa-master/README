This repository contains all files required to produce PDF/A compliant
documents with a pdflatex workflow. One of them is a template which
need to be renamed to match the .tex file name and filled out with
appropriate metadata.

Instructions are here: https://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/creating-pdfa-documents-for-long-term-archiving/

Switch to the 'minimalexample' folder and run pdflatex on document.tex
in it to see a first result with dummy data. Use 'diff' to see where
dummy data was filled in.
