\chapter{Ringraziamenti}
\label{cap:ringraziamenti}

I would like to thank my parents, my sister and the rest of my family for the support they gave me during these years of studies.
I would also like to thank all my friends who endured me, with a special mention to Denise, Ugo, Bianca and Ilaria.
A special thank goes to Stefano, my supervisor, who guided me during the first stages of my research and to all the research group here in Padova.
